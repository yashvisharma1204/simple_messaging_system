### Description:
This Python project implements a messaging system using the stack data structure. The system allows users to send, receive, and manage messages efficiently. By utilizing the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle of stacks, the latest messages are prioritized for easy access.

### Features:
- **Sending Messages**: Users can send messages to specified recipients.
- **Retrieving Latest Message:** The system retrieves and displays the most recent message from the inbox.
- **Retrieving All Messages:** Users can view and manage their entire message history.
- **Deleting Messages:** Unwanted messages can be deleted from the inbox.
- **Popping Messages:** Users have the option to remove the latest message from the stack.

### Installation:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the messaging_system.py file using Python 3.

### Usage:
-Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the messaging system.
-Choose options from the menu to send messages, retrieve messages, delete messages, or exit the program.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
